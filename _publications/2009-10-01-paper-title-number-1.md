excerpt: 'Being able to infer the number of people in a specific area is of extreme importance for the 
avoidance of crowd disasters and to facilitate emergency evacuations. Here, using a football 
stadium and an airport as case studies, we present evidence of a strong relationship 
between the number of people in restricted areas and activity recorded by mobile phone 
providers and the online service Twitter. Our findings suggest that data generated through 
our interactions with mobile phone networks and the Internet may allow us to gain valuable 
measurements of the current state of society.'
