excerpt: 'The increasing availability of mobile phone data has attracted the attention of several researchers interested in studying our collective behaviour. Our interactions with the phone network can take several forms, from SMS messages to phone calls and data usage. Typically, mobile phone data are released to researchers in the form of call detail records, which contain records of different types of interactions, and can be used to analyse various aspects of our behaviour. However, the inherently behavioural nature of these interactions may result in differences between how we make phone calls and receive text messages. Studies which rely on data derived from these interactions, therefore, need to carefully consider these differences. Here, we aim to investigate differences and limitations of different types of mobile phone interactions data by analysing a large mobile phone dataset. We study the relationship between different types of interactions and show how it changes over time. We anticipate our findings to be of interest to all researchers working in the area of computational social science.'
