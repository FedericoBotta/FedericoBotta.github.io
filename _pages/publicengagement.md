I have a strong commitment to engaging with the general public and to promoting public awareness of science across all demographic groups. I have given talks to a range of different audiences, from young children to the elderly.

I am a founder and co-organiser of <a href="https://databeerswrik.tumblr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Databeers Warwick</a>, a series of public engagement events around the topic of data science.

A selection of public engagement and outreach events I have spoken at includes:

* Ideas Cafe, Leamington Spa, 2017
  * Talk for elderly members of the local community
* City College Coventry, Coventry, 2016
  * Talk for 16-18 year olds
* Three Minute Thesis competition, University of Warwick, 2016
  * Finalist in the university-wide event
* Festival of Imagination, University of Warwick, 2015
  * Interactive exhibits for children
* ESRC Festival of Social Science, Herbert Museum, Coventry, 2014
  * Poster presentation

My talk in the final of the Three Minute Thesis competition is available here:
