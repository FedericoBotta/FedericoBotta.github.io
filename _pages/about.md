Hi!

I am a Lecturer in data science in the department of computer science at the University of Exeter, and I am also a fellow at the Alan Turing Insitute, the UK national institute for data science and AI. My research aims to provide a deeper understanding of human behaviour, both at the collective and individual level, by using novel data streams. Large data sets are constantly being generated thanks to our interactions with large technological systems, such as the Internet and the mobile phone network, or they can be collected through our usage of smart phone apps and tracking sensors. I use tools from data science, network theory, behavioural and computational social sciences to analyse these data sets and investigate different aspects of human behaviour.

I am also an organiser ofÂ <a href="https://databeerswrik.tumblr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Databeers Warwick</a>, an informal networking event for all those interested in data stories.

I am an academic editor for <a href="http://plosone.org" target = "_blank" rel="no opener no referrer">PLOS ONE</a> and I act as a reviewer for several international journals.
