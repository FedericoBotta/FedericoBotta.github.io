Hi!

I am a Research Fellow in the <a href="http://datasciencelab.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Science Lab</a> at Warwick Business School. My research aims to provide a deeper understanding of human behaviour, both at the collective and individual level, by using novel data streams. Large data sets are constantly being generated thanks to our interactions with large technological systems, such as the Internet and the mobile phone network, or they can be collected through our usage of smart phone apps and tracking sensors. I use tools from data science, network theory, behavioural and computational social sciences to analyse these data sets and investigate different aspects of human behaviour.

I am also an organiser of <a href="https://databeerswrik.tumblr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Databeers Warwick</a>, an informal networking event for all those interested in data stories.
