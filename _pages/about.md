I am a Research Fellow in the <a href="http://datasciencelab.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Science Lab</a> at Warwick Business School looking at how complex social systems behave. I am an organiser of <a href="https://databeerswrik.tumblr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Databeers Warwick</a>, an informal networking event for all those interested in data stories.

After an undergraduate degree in Physics and a Masters degree in theoretical physics both at <a href="http://www.unimib.it/go/102/Home/English" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca</a>, I joined the <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/complexity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doctoral Training Centre in Complexity Science</a> at the <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Warwick</a>. I received a second Masters degree in Complexity Science and then carried on to obtain my PhD.

<a href="http://www.fedebotta.com/?page_id=128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My research</a> focuses on complex social systems and is aimed at providing a deeper understanding of how such systems behave. Technological devices, such as smart phones, and technological systems, such as the Internet, provide an unprecedented source of information on human behaviour and my work focuses on investigating how people interact with these systems.

These interactions often contribute to create a deeply interconnected structure that can be analysed using tools from network science, a recent interdisciplinary part of complex systems science.

Using different tools ranging from network theory to physical and computer sciences, I analyse large data sets to study social systems and human behaviour. Part of my research also focuses on improving current techniques in the analysis of networked systems.

I am also an elected <a href="https://cssociety.org/about-us/council" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Council Member of the Complex Systems Society</a>, a member of the <a href="https://cssociety.org/ccs/ccs-steering-committee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steering Committee of the Conference on Complex Systems</a>, an Advisory Board member of the <a href="http://www.yrncs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Young Researchers Networks on Complex Systems</a> and a registered independent <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expert for European research and innovation</a>, for which I acted as an external expert and evaluator in the H2020 framework.

I have presented <a href="http://www.fedebotta.com/?page_id=138" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talks and posters at international conferences</a> and attended various <a href="http://www.fedebotta.com/?page_id=52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">schools for doctoral students</a>.

I have <a href="http://www.fedebotta.com/?page_id=85" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">undergraduate and postgraduate teaching experience</a> and in the academic year 2013/2014 <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/ldc/personal/funding/watepgr/2014/federicobotta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I was awarded a commendation in the Warwick Award for Teaching Excellence for Postgraduate Research Students</a>.

I serve as peer reviewer for international journals (<a href="https://www.nature.com/srep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scientific Reports</a>, <a href="http://www.plosone.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PLOS ONE</a>, <a href="https://www.epletters.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Europhysics Letters (EPL)</a>, <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7756">IEEE Pervasive Computing</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03784371">Physica A</a>, <a href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/physics-letters-a">Physics Letters A,</a> <a href="https://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/garson/SSCORE/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Science Computer Review</a>) and for international conferences (IC2S2, ICWSM, CCS, SocInfo, Data for Policy, Complex Networks, Complenet, NetSci, NetSci X). I have been on the <a href="http://complenet.weebly.com/organizers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Program Committee of Complenet'18</a>.
