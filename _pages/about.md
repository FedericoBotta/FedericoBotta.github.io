I am a Research Fellow in the <a href="http://datasciencelab.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Science Lab</a> at Warwick Business School. My research aims to provide a deeper understanding of human behaviour, both at the collective and individual level, by using novel data streams. Large data sets are constantly being generated thanks to our interactions with large technological systems, such as the Internet and the mobile phone network, or they can be collected through our usage of smart phone apps and tracking sensors. I use tools from data science, network theory, behavioural and computational social sciences to analyse these data sets and investigate different aspects of human behaviour.

I am also an organiser of <a href="https://databeerswrik.tumblr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Databeers Warwick</a>, an informal networking event for all those interested in data stories.

After an undergraduate degree in Physics and a Masters degree in theoretical physics both at <a href="http://www.unimib.it/go/102/Home/English" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca</a>, I joined the <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/complexity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doctoral Training Centre in Complexity Science</a> at the <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Warwick</a>. I received a second Masters degree in Complexity Science and then carried on to obtain my PhD.
